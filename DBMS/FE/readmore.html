<p>In a step towards bringing transparency in the tendering process, the Punjab government has decided to implement e-Procurement system for various types of procurements of goods and services in its Departments/Board/Corporations to obtain the most competitive and suitable bids from the bidders.

Introduction of e-Procurement will enable the Government to introduce ease and efficiency without compromising on the required procedures. e-Procurement will provide transparency, result in savings of time and money, shortening of procurement cycle, ease of operation to the implementing organization and to the vendors. The automation would drastically reduce the use of pap er work and will bring down the expenditure incurred on the publication of the large size tender notices. The most important aspect is that contractors are no more required to come to the office for tendering process.

This online solution - TENERWIZARD will be utilized by all the Departments/Boards/Corporations of Government of Punjab along with their vendors. It is a real-time bidding solution for buyers which will provide an exceptional level of profitability, control and simplification to the tendering process. This solution also facilitates faster dissemination and easy access to information related to Government of Punjab tenders.<p>
